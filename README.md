Strategic Dashboard:

I've developed a strategic dashboard that assesses the Superstore dataset. This dashboard includes visualizations for sales, profits, average discount, and order count, employing a combination of area charts, bar charts, and line charts. 
As part of this project, I've enriched the analytical experience by incorporating a narrative element. Through visualizations coupled with insightful commentary, I explore various aspects such as binder volatility, introduce a growth strategy tailored for the Southern region, and conduct an analysis of the product assortment.
